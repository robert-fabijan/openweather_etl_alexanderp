## Context
This repository is being developed to showcase my skills in working with Python, CI/CD using GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Platform, and Terraform. Using these technologies, I extract data from *openweathermap.org* and load it to BigQuery. The code is designed with the Strategy Design Pattern.
